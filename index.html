									<p>
										Radio operators have noticed that air pollution can enhance the range of short wavelength radio signals. 
										The signal bounces between the pollution layer and the ground much like light travels through a fiber optic cable. 
										The theory behind this project is that the angle which the signal is refracted yields information about the constituents of the pollution. 
										Other methods only sample a very small fraction of the inversion layer. 
										Our approach, with a network of small transmitters and receivers, could measure a large portion of the inversion simultaneously. 
										By knowing the position of the antenna, the received signal strength, and some simple geometry, we can determine how much the signal is affected. 
										As this is a complex and ongoing experiment, my project was to design and build signal filters that assist in the determination of the quality of signals refracted from the inversion layer. 
										The highest quality signal occurs when the receiving antenna is aligned with the incoming radio waves.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project required me to design and build my filter bank from scratch, determining the best components and their placement on the circuits. 
										There were many challenges to overcome and bugs to fix. 
										For example, most of the components were reliant on eachother and highly sensitive. 
										This means that if even one of the component's values was off by a fraction of an ohm, it would skew the results of the filter. 
										I overcame this by doing tedious calculations over the course of two weeks.
										When I was finished with the project, I presented it to an audience at Geek Fest held at the school.

										<h2><a href="#">Asteroids</a></h2>

									<p>
										Asteroids is a spin-off of the original game.
										You get to destroy asteroids with laser-beams from your starship.
										When all of the asteroids have been destroyed, you have won the game.
										In my version I included an Octocat to keep you company as you complete your quest to take back the stars.
									</p>
									<p>
										I had to think creatively to imagine and visulize how the game needed to look and run, and use critical thinking skills to enact what was visualized through creativity. 
										I worked with the SI and other students to work through problems and bugs, and to ask opinions on ideas.
										This project taught me a lot about software design concepts and techniques for games.
										I gained an appreciation of how complex and challenging a video game can be to create.
